## What is this site? {/*what-is-this-site*/}

We are rewriting the React documentation with a few differences:

- All explanations are **written using Hooks** rather than classes.
- We've added **interactive examples** and visual diagrams.
- Guides include **challenges (with solutions!)** to check your understanding.

This beta website contains the current draft of the new docs.

## This is a work in progress! {/*this-is-a-work-in-progress*/}
